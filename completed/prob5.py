#Problem 5: What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20

#I did not write a program for this, instead I found the prime factorization for all the numbers from 1 to 20,
#And took the largest group for each prime number and multiplied them together

#16=2*2*2*2
#9=3*3
#5=5
#7=7
#11=11
#13=13
#17=17
#19=19
